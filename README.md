# Video-Shazam-Multimedia
Shazam for video files 

Collaboratively developed a video search and indexing application. Created a database of processed video frames by calculating motion vectors, residual frames, and average residue. Designed a deep learning model to recognize and learn video signatures in the database. Utilized sliding window analysis on the frame motion residue to pinpoint the exact timeframe of the query video within the actual video post-signature recognition. Developed an interactive video player using Python's Tkinter and multithreading libraries, incorporating features such as pause, play, rewind, and seek.
